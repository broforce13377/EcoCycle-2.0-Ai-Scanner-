# EcoCycle-2.0-Ai-Scanner-
📱 EcoCycle Application – IoT Verification & Scanner Interfaces

This repository represents part of the EcoCycle 2.0 application, a smart sustainability platform designed to support responsible waste disposal through the integration of IoT, AI, and user-centered interface design.

The application focuses on visual and auditory feedback to clearly communicate system status and verification outcomes to users during the recycling process.

🔍 What This Repository Contains


🔊 The Audio Scanner page, which provides sound-based feedback to indicate scanning activity and successful verification, enhancing accessibility and user assurance 


🎯 Purpose of the Implementation

The goal of this implementation is to demonstrate how frontend technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) can be used to simulate real-time IoT verification interactions, making invisible system processes (such as sensor validation and transaction confirmation) visible, intuitive, and trustworthy for users.

This interface was developed as part of an academic Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) project, emphasizing:

Clear system feedback

Error prevention

User confidence and transparency

Alignment with smart-city and sustainability use cases
